# Algosto : May randomness be with you

Algosto, from the concatenation of french words *Algorithmes Stochastiques (/al.ɡo.ʁitm stɔ.kas.tik/)*, 
is a Python package built on top of *NumPy* that provides implementations of various stochastic algorithms.

The full documentation is available [here](https://www.algosto.dev).

## Installation

You can install Algosto with:

    pip install algosto

## Usage

This section shows an example on how Algosto works by applying the
stochastic gradient descent algorithm (SGD) to a quadratic function.

### Workflow

The basic workflow needs four elements :

**An objective function :** This is the function we want to minimize.
    It is a Python function that takes a numpy matrix `(n, d)`,
    where `n` is the number of points to handle and `d` is the dimension of points,
    and returns a result vector of length `n`.

**A constraint :** It is an object that defines the space in which the solver will optimize the function.
    Obviously, the objective function needs to be defined on this space.

**A solver :** In Algosto, solvers are always classes that need an objective function and a constraint to be instanciated.
    Simply call the `fit` method to minimize the objective on the constraint.

**A plot :** Algosto provides some functions to plot most used graph.
    You can build your own graph using *Matplotlib* or *Plotly*.

### Objective function

Based on the workflow given just before, we start by defining the quadratic objective function
and its gradient in order to use the SGD.

    import numpy as np

    def objective(x: np.array) -> float :
        return np.sum(x**2, axis=1)

    def grad(x: np.array) -> float :
        return 2*x

> [!WARNING]
> As said before, objective functions and gradients need to be able to process multiple points simultaneously to work with Algosto.
> Specifically, if the function operates on points of dimension `d`, it should accept a numpy array with shape `(n, d)`
> and returns a numpy array of length `n`, where `n` is the number of points provided to the objective function or gradient.

Algosto provides some toy objective functions, of which the quadratic function is a part, that you can import like this :

    from algosto.utils.functions import quadratic

    objective, grad = quadratic()

> [!NOTE]
> You can find a list of all available functions in the [references](https://www.algosto.dev/references/utils/functions/index.html)
> section of the documentation.

### Constraints

Now, we need to specify the definition space. 
To do that, Algosto provides object called *constraints* that you can import from the module ``algosto.constraints`` as follow :

    import numpy as np
    from algosto.constraints import RdBallConstraint

    ct = RdBallConstraint(2, np.zeros(2), 5)

We define a two-dimensional ball in $\mathbb{R}^d$, centered at the origin.
Constraints provide the solver with information about the space within which it can optimize the objective function.

> [!NOTE]
> You can find a list of all available constraints in the [references](https://www.algosto.dev/references/constraints/index.html)
> section of the documentation.

> [!NOTE]
> If your constraint is not yet implemented, you can define your own.
> Refer to the constraint chapter in the cookbook to learn how.

### Solver

It's time to speak about the solver itself.
Solvers are avaible from the `algosto.solvers` module where you can find all the solvers implemented in Algosto.
In this example, we are going to use the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) to minimize the objective.

    from algosto.solvers import SGDSolver

    solver = SGDSolver(ct, objective)   

> [!NOTE]
> You can find a list of all available solvers in the [references](https://www.algosto.dev/references/solvers/index.html)
> section of the documentation.

Finally, we can minimize the objective function with the help of the `fit` method :

    from algosto.utils import plot

    solver.fit()

    plot(solver)

### Full workflow code

The full Python code is avaible just below

    import numpy as np
    from algosto.functions import quadratic
    from algosto.constraints import RdBallConstraint
    from algosto.solvers import SGDSolver
    from algosto.evaluate import trajectory

    objective, grad = quadratic()

    ct = RdBallConstraint(2, np.zeros(2), 5)

    solver = SGDSolver(ct, objective, grad)

    solver.fit()

    plot(solver)
